### Heatmap with Temporal Animation
This visualization shows earthquake events plotted on a world map, with a time slider that animates daily activity. Each point’s color represents the earthquake’s magnitude, while its size reflects the relative depth. The animation highlights how seismic activity evolves over time, revealing clusters of events and regional patterns.

### Magnitude vs Depth Scatter Plot
This scatter plot compares earthquake magnitude against depth. The y-axis is inverted so that shallow earthquakes appear at the top, making it easier to see that most high-magnitude events occur closer to the Earth’s surface. The color scale reinforces magnitude differences, and tooltips provide contextual details such as location.

### Earthquake Frequency Over Time
This line chart aggregates earthquakes by date, showing how the number of events fluctuates over time. Peaks in the chart often correspond to aftershock sequences or bursts of seismic activity in specific regions. This visualization provides a temporal overview that complements the spatial and depth-based analyses.
